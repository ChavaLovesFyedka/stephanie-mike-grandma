# Dear Grandma

## Description

Dear Grandma is a fun little web-app that allows you to create your own madlibs! Users can either create their own using our special notation or just fill in one of the templates. Users can also email either the finished letter or the form for a friend to fill out.

## Features

• Create your own madlib from scratch

• Fill in a madlib template

• Email the finished letter to a friend

• Email the your custom madlib template to a friend


## Usage

To use Dear Grandma first choose a template or create your own. If you choose a template, fill in the boxes with your own words that satisfy the part of speech. After, hit submit and see the result. From there you can email it to a friend.

To create your own template, choose "Create your own" and follow the instructions. Basically you can write your own letter or story in the text area and wherever you want another user to fill in a word, simply wrap it in double curly braces as seen here: {{ }}. Whatever you put in the braces will show up as the placeholder text in the next screen.
