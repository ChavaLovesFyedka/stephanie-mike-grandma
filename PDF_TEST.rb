# Dear Grandma,
# I am writing this letter because I wanted to say thank you for the delicious cookies and awesome presents that you sent us. You make the best cookies ever, and I always love it when we get them from you.
# Remember when you made those chocolate chip cookies last Easter and we all decorated them? That was so much fun and those cookies were so yummy.
# Mom said that you are planning on coming to visit us again soon, so I shouldnâ€™t be impatient about it. I am excited about the next time that I will see you.
# Thank you for the presents. I hope that you have a great day, and I miss you,
# Love,
# Tommy
